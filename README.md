# Portfolio
## About me
Hey. My name is Halya. I graduated from a translation department in Lviv, my home city. I worked as a customer support manager at an IT company for 2 years; I don't have any real IT experience though, since it was just a customer support position. At the time when I came across the Dare IT challenge ad, I was searching for a new direction. Since I had just been laid off, I thought: 'Why not?'. 

I was seriously worried I would not cope with the challenge because all I could basically do was speak good English and communicate with customers. I'm really happy I overcame the impostor syndrome and actually made it to the end of the challenge. Hooray! 

It wasn't a piece of cake for someone with no prior testing and Python knowledge, I must admit. But it made me realize that you don't always have to feel 100% confident to start something new. In fact, it's better if you don't. This way you'll grow even more. 

So in this portfolio I'll be presenting only the things that I mastered during the last 6 weeks.
